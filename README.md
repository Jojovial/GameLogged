# GameLogged

This is a video game backlog tracker for all your games that you've hoarded but haven't played!
The point is to be able to keep track of games you want to play, have played, have beaten, have completed 100%, or keep track of games you may want eventually!
You can also keep track of specific moments in your video game entries with the memory card feature!
Coming Soon : Video Game Cover Image Upload
